Operation:

1 - Open the Anaconda navigator - > Launch Spyder - > Run Interface.py

2 - You can use 1 and 2 dimensional datasets, using the Lenet and Alexnet models, if you prefer you can edit the number of layers creating a custom model.

3 - You can use the default parameters to run the models or edit the parameters.

4 - After running the models the results are saved in their respective folder, you can also view the results through the application.
